This is my other project / game which I was creating in the process of learing Python language from various sources.

Player is usuing arrows to navigate snake in order to each randomly created food on the board. /n
Game can be paused / resumed by clicking SPACE button. /n
Once Player hit himself game will end and score will be displayed. /n
ESC key allows to exit the game. /n
In the code there is a possibility to enable/disable snake crossing boundaries.
