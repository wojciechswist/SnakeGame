This is my other project / game which I was creating in the process of learing Python language from various sources.

Player is usuing arrows to navigate snake in order to each randomly created food on the board.
Game can be paused / resumed by clicking SPACE button.
Once Player hit himself game will end and score will be displayed.
ESC key allows to exit the game.
In the code there is a possibility to enable/disable snake crossing boundaries.
